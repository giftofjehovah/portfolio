For my final year independent research paper, I examined the structural discrimination of Singaporeâ€™s homeless population and utilized qualitative and secondary research methodologies to bolster my findings. With these experience, I am able to empathize with counterparts, enabling me to connect and work with people from all over the world.</p>

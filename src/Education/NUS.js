        <p>My background in Sociology honed my critical thinking and armed me with research methodologies and experience to harness answers to difficult questions. For my final year independent research paper, I examined the structural discrimination of Singaporeâ€™s homeless population and utilized qualitative and secondary research methodologies to bolster my findings. With these experience, I am able to empathize with counterparts, enabling me to connect and work with people from all over the world.</p>
